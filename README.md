## Roadmap

### [Pork Ramen](https://www.chowhound.com/recipes/slow-cooker-pork-ramen-31178)

* Recommended by a coworker
* Pork is quite tasty, as is ramen, so hopes are high for this

## Tried and True

### [Olive Garden Chicken Pasta](https://www.themagicalslowcooker.com/slow-cooker-olive-garden-chicken-pasta/)

* This is an absolute madlad
* Makes about 1.5 weeks of food at 1 meal a day
* Italian and good, but on the rich side for sure

### [Beef Stroganoff](https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/slow-cooker-beef-stroganoff/1b3f2c90-0924-4744-a7c2-1b82a4d4e133)

* Def super legit
* If you like mushrooms, put more into this than you are expecting (they shrink)
* On the rich side, but not as much as the Olive Garden

### [Texas Pulled Pork](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/92462/slow-cooker-texas-pulled-pork/)

* Very tasty
* On the wet side, but goes great on sandwiches if youll eat it quick
* Great on quesaldillas as well
